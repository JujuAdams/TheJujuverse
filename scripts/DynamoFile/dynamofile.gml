/// Sets up an Included File to watch for changes. If DYNAMO_AUTO_SCAN is set to <true> then
/// watched Included Files will be scanned for changes automatically. You can check if a file has
/// changed by calling DynamoFileChanged() and the file can be loaded with DynamoFileLoad().
/// 
/// If you call DynamoFileLoad() then the Included File will be loaded whether there have been
/// changes or not, and the callback provided when calling DynamoFile() will be executed. The
/// callback will be handed two arguments: argument0 is the content parsed from the file (see
/// below) and argument1 is the callback data provided when calling DynamoFile(). If there're
/// any problems whilst parsing data found in a file then <undefined> will be passed to the
/// callback as argument0.
/// 
/// Dynamo will automatically parse the file depending on what value <dataFormat> is set to:
///    "json"      Content is parsed as JSON
///    "csv"       Content is parsed as CSV: comma-separated, with strings delimited by double quotes
///    "string"    Content is parsed as UTF8-formatted plaintext
///    "buffer"    Content is not parsed and content is instead returned to the callback as a buffer index
/// 
/// N.B. Much like GameMaker's native asynchronous load functionality, the buffer returned to the
///      callback is destroyed immediately after your callback function finishes executing. If you
///      want to keep the buffer data around then you'll need to make and keep a copy yourself.
/// 
/// If the <autoLoad> argument is set to <true> when calling DynamoFile() then the file will
/// automatically be loaded and parsed whenever a change is detected, executing the callback as
/// though DynamoFileLoad() had been called directly for the file.
/// 
/// Note that setting up a file watcher will not initially load a file. If you want immediate
/// access to data inside a file at the start of your game you'll need to call DynamoFileLoad().
