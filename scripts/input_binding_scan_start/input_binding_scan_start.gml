/// @desc    Starts a binding scan, allowing the player to create new bindings based on what
///          keyboard/mouse/gamepad input they have provided.
///          
///          The success callback is executed when Input received input from the player. The
///          function is executed with a single parameter: the binding that was created by the
///          player. This can then be set to a particular verb.
///          
///          The failure callback, if one is provided, is executed when binding fails for some
///          reason. It is executed with one parameter, the error coded. This corresponds to
///          a member of the INPUT_BINDING_SCAN_EVENT enum:
///              .SOURCE_INVALID         Player’s source is invalid, usually because they have no sources assigned or their gamepad has been disconnected
///              .SOURCE_CHANGED         The player’s source (or sources) have been modified
///              .PLAYER_IS_GHOST        Player is a ghost and cannot receive hardware input
///              .SCAN_TIMEOUT           Either the player didn’t enter a new binding or a stuck key prevented the system from working. The timeout period is defined by INPUT_BINDING_SCAN_TIMEOUT
///              .LOST_FOCUS             The application lost focus
///              .PLAYER_DISCONNECTED    The player disconnected
///              .ABORTED                Binding scan was aborted early due to input_binding_scan_abort() being called
///          
///          A source filter, an array of sources, can be provided to selectively listen for
///          input. This is useful when you wish to scan for input from a specific device.
///          Input from any device NOT listed in the source filter array will be ignored. By
///          default, all sources assigned to the player are accepted.
///          
/// @param   successCallback
/// @param   [failureCallback]
