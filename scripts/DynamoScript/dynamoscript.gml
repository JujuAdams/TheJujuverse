/// Sets up a script to watch for changes. If DYNAMO_AUTO_SCAN is set to <true> then watched
/// scripts will be scanned for changes automatically. You can check if a script has  changed
/// by calling DynamoScriptChanged(), and the script can be loaded and its changes applied with
/// DynamoScriptLoad().
/// 
/// Because data is being stored in a script and *not* instead a function, the code inside a
/// script is executed on boot by the GameMaker runtime as you'd expect. This means that, unlike
/// file watchers, data represented inside a Dynamo script is immediately available.
/// 
/// There are many limitations to what can be done with Dynamo and scripts. It's best to think
/// about Dynamo scripts as being as complex as JSON but no further. It is possible to reference
/// basic numbers and strings (of course!) as well as being able to nest arrays and structs as
/// you would in JSON. You may also reference asset names and GameMaker constants. You cannot,
/// however, create functions inside Dynamo scripts. You can't use conditional branching or loops
/// or anything that controls programme "flow". Dynamo is also expecting all variables you're
/// defining in the script to be globals.
/// 
/// If you call DynamoScriptLoad() then the script will be loaded, and its changed applied,
/// whether there have been changes or not, and the callback provided when calling DynamoScript()
/// will be executed. The callback will be handed one arguments: the callback data provided when
/// calling DynamoScript().
/// 
/// If the <autoLoad> argument is set to <true> when calling DynamoScript() then the script will
/// automatically be loaded and applied whenever a change is detected, executing the callback as
/// though DynamoScriptLoad() had been called directly for the file.
/// 
/// Note that setting up a script watcher will not automatically execute the callback on boot.
/// If you want to execute the callback at the start of your game you'll need to call
/// DynamoScriptLoad() directly yourself.
